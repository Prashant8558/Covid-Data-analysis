# Covid-Data-analysis

# ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE :-

Sentiment analysis on tweets related to the covid data analysis can be useful for understanding public opinion, tracking trends, and identifying potential areas of concern. In this task, we can use machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression or support vector machines, to predict the sentiment of a given tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.

# INTRODUCTION :-

Text classification with the help of machine learning can be achieved using many ML algorithm like Logistic Regression with Grid Search CV
Decision Tree Classifier(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).
KNN(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).
SVM Classifier (Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).
Random Forest(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).
Stochastic Gradient Descent(Count Vector and TF ID Vectorization techniques).


# DATA PREPROCESSING :-

After loading the dataset and before building the models , the text should be cleaned and preprocessed to achieve better accuracy. Data preprocessing means to change the data in a way that it is more effective while building a model by minimizing the least important features in the data. It will include lowercasing, tokenization, punctuation removal, stopword removal like task.

# Feature Manipulation & Selection :-

It will include Extract relevant features from the data and transform them into a format that can be used for machine learning and Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm or a combination of algorithms to solve the problem at hand.

# Model training :-

Split the data into training and testing sets, and train the model on the training set. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set and tune the hyperparameters accordingly.Here, we use 70/30 ratio data spliting so get effective train & test data set.

# CONCLUSION :-

1.We applied 6 models namely, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier,Stochastic Gradient Descent , KNN, SVM,Extra Trees 

2..We conclude that the machine is generating after tunning the best results for the Extra Tree model with an Accuracy of 78.66% .

3.In the future ,we can repeat the analysis and compare it with the present sentimental analysis to gauge the impact of the initiatives on the ground.
